## Project Overview

Lokey is a high-availability, high-bandwidth true random number generation service. The name derives from Loki, the Norse god of chaos, reflecting the unpredictable nature of true randomness, and "key" indicating its accessibility and utility as a keystone service for cryptographic applications.

This project provides affordable and accessible true randomness through off-the-shelf components with a Go implementation. The implementation uses a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and an ATECC608A cryptographic chip, creating a hardware-based solution with a modest bill of materials costing approximately €50.

## Services That Benefit from True Random Data

- Local hardware deployment for air-gapped or high-security environments
- Integration with HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) for enterprise applications


## System Architecture

### Components

Lokey consists of three main microservices:

1. **Controller Service**: Interfaces with the ATECC608A chip to harvest true random numbers (TRNG) and process SHA-256 hashes
2. **Fortuna Service**: Amplifies the entropy using the Fortuna algorithm for enhanced randomness
3. **API Service**: Provides endpoints for configuration and both raw TRNG and Fortuna-amplified data retrieval

### Technical Architecture

The system uses a microservices architecture with three containerized applications that communicate via HTTP APIs:

- **Controller Service (Stateless)**: Interfaces with the ATECC608A hardware to generate TRNG data on demand
- **Fortuna Service (Stateless)**: Provides cryptographic amplification of random data using the Fortuna algorithm
- **API Service (Stateful)**: Centralizes all data storage, manages polling, and provides a unified API for configuration and data retrieval

The architecture employs a centralized database model where only the API service maintains persistent storage, while the Controller and Fortuna services operate as stateless microservices.

## Features

- **Hardware-based TRNG**: True Random Number Generation using ATECC608A cryptographic chip
- **High Availability**: Reliable and continuously available random number generation
- **Dual Access Modes**: Raw TRNG and Fortuna-amplified randomness options
- **Cryptographic Amplification**: Fortuna algorithm implementation for enhanced entropy
- **Centralized Storage**: Single database with queue-based storage and configurable sizes
- **Stateless Services**: Controller and Fortuna services operate as stateless microservices
- **Configurable Polling**: Adjustable intervals for TRNG and Fortuna data generation
- **Multiple Data Formats**: Support for various formats including int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, and binary
- **Flexible Consumption**: Configurable consumption behavior (e.g., delete-on-read)
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks
- **API Documentation**: Swagger documentation for all endpoints

- ATECC608A cryptographic chip (for hardware TRNG)
- Go 1.24+ (for development)
- Docker Buildx (for cross-compiling ARM images)
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (for production deployment)

### Local Development

To run Lokey on your development machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lokey.git
   cd lokey
   ```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the API at http://localhost:8080
4. View API documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

### Cross-Compilation & Raspberry Pi Deployment

Lokey can be cross-compiled on a development machine and deployed to a Raspberry Pi:

#### Development Machine Setup

1. Create `buildx.toml` configuration file in your project root:

   ```toml
   [registry."lokey-registry:5000"]
     insecure = true
     http = true

   # insecure-entitlements allows insecure entitlements, disabled by default.
   insecure-entitlements = [ "network.host", "security.insecure" ]
   ```

2. Build ARM images and push to local registry:

   ```bash
   # Sets up a local registry and builds ARM images
   task build_images_and_registry
   ```

   This task:
   - Creates a Docker network for registry communication
   - Runs a local registry container
   - Sets up a Buildx builder with appropriate configuration
   - Cross-compiles ARM-compatible images
   - Pushes the images to the local registry

#### Raspberry Pi Configuration

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi following the hardware guide in `device/HowToSetup.md`

2. Configure Docker on the Raspberry Pi to trust your development machine's registry:

   ```bash
   # Replace with your development machine's IP address
   DEV_IP=192.168.1.100

   # Update Docker daemon configuration
   echo "{
     \"insecure-registries\": [\"$DEV_IP:5000\"]
   }" | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json

   # Restart Docker to apply changes
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

3. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file on the Pi with your development machine's IP:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:

2. **High Availability**: Ensure the service is reliable and continuously available
3. **High Bandwidth**: Deliver sufficient random data throughput for demanding applications
4. **Flexibility**: Offer both raw TRNG and cryptographically amplified random data
